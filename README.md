    ### Deviations from spec
     - Instead of making it depend on typing out movements, I've made it respond to mouse movement where a user can point and click or simply drag the mouse to the destination of their choosing within the player mode.
     - Another major one is that I haven't made it modular yet. I haven't crated different modules, then export them there in order to import them in the main game. Everything is in a single file. This is due to time constraints on my side and the number of assessments I had to do over 1 weekend. This was the only one due on Monday. But one can see that I worked on it over the weekend if one checks the git log history. I had a major bug that delayed my progress as this was not my initial intention.
     - I've deployed to GithubPages instead of CodePen. This is also due to time constraints

    ### Known Defects
     - No test suit like Jest installed and applied
